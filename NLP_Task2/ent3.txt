Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions.Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on illuminated manuscripts and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.
