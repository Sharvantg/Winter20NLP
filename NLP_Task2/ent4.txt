Theatre performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to Hellenistic times when leading musicians and actors performed widely at poetical competitions, for example at Delphi, Delos, Ephesus.Aristotle and his teacher Plato both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?
