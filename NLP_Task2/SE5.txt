Films are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: documentary film, for example, aims to create a record or inform, although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning:The Lumière brothers were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public. In 1908, Pathé launched and distributed newsreels and by World War I, films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. In the first decade of the century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and news films.The Americans first contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images, but the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle.
